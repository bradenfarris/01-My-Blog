# Blog Post 4: Lake City area of Colorado

Lake City is the most isolated town in the lower 48, as it takes over 45 minutes to reach the next closest town. Lake City is locatd in Hinsdale County of south central Colorado and is the only incorporated town in the entire county. With isolation like this in the Rocky Mountains, the wildlife is prestine. Lake City is just the town for which many outdoor enthusiasts come in for supplies and what not. The national forests, mountain ranges, and Alpine Loop is what the people come for, including myself. I have been to Lake City three times, all within the last three years. The elevation of the campground my family and I have used is at an elevation of 10,000 feet and is considered in the alpine. It is in fact so elevated that whenever we camp, which is during the summer, we wake up to a frost covered campsite. But the alpine frost is well worth it, as the wildlife and scenic views of the Rocky Mountains give us a reason to endure the summer cold. 

## The Rocky Mountains

The Rocky Mountains got there name from the rocky look that they protrude. The rocks that formed the Rocky Mountains come from being raised from tectonic forces dating back to 1.7 billion years ago. These rocks in the southern Rocky Mountains formed into mountains about 300 million years ago, consisting of Precambrian metamorphic rock that were forced upward through layers of limestone laid down in the shallow sea. They later eroded throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, leaving behind sedimentary rock. The sedintary rock of southern Colorado continued to rise for millions of year, after tectonic rising and gradual erosion shaped the mountains into what they are today. During the pleistocene and holocene era of the ice ages, which were 1.8 mya-70,000 years ago, glacial landforms arose from the large ice movement. 

Specifically the San Juan mountains (which Lake City calls home) volcanic rock makes a unique appearance, from which they came 66-2.6 mya. The San Juan mountains are some of the highest in the Rockies, and are special because of the high altitude plateaus and peaks that are so prominent, and which can be seen from driving the Alpine Loop. The San Juan mountains are some of the best in the world when it comes to hiking 14ers, because they are accesible and can be climbed because of the plateaus present. 


## The Flora

The flora of the San Juan mountains is often one-sided for most of the year. During the winter months you will be hardpressed to find much vegetation besided the vast amounts of trees that are seen everywhere. Pine trees (*Pinus*) and aspen trees (*Populus*) are the surefire plants to encounter. They grow in large tree stands along the mountains, lakes, and valleys, but will not be seen in high altitudes where no vegetation exists. During the summer however there is a great shift in the flora, as wildflowers fill alpine slopes, and mountain valleys. Flower enthusiasts come every summer to enjoy the vast multitude of colorful flowers that arise at such high elevations. During the fall the aspens turn golden, and the forests of the San Juan mountains turn into a golden sea of trees. 

## The Fauna 

The fauna of the San Juan mountains, in which Lake City sits, are unique for a couple of reasons. One is that since it is in an alpine environment, there are many animals that will only reside in such high altitudes. One example is the yellow-bellied marmot (*Marmota flaviventris*), a type of ground squirrel that can only be found at very high elevations in the Rocky mountains. They hibernate eight months out of the year, but when they are seen running along the mountain ridges, there short, fat bodies are comical. As far as the alpine fauna, they may be the only animal you see along the Alpine Loop. The other animal that makes the Lake City area so unique is the moose (*Alces alces*). They were reintroduced in 1991 and they now inhabit the Lake City area in safe number. They can be seen in the marshes along Lake San Cristobal, the lake which Lake City is named after. Or the the Deer Lakes area outside of Lake City, which is even high in elevation. I myself have experienced over a dozen moose in my visits to both San Critobal and Deer lakes. Every time I catch myself doing a double take, because they are so large and wild. Besides the moose, another Lake City staple is the mule deer (*Odocoileus hemionus*), which can be found both in the forests and in the middle of town. Elk (*Cervus canadensis*) can be heard bugeling during the rut in the valleys between mountains during the rut, and it is a sound that makes the hair on your back rise up. The natural predator for all of these large animals is the black bear (*Ursus americanus*) which I have seen along San Cristobal. Another introduced animal into the Lake City area is the lynx (*Lynx rufus*). They are almost impossible to sight, due to there keen awareness of their surroundings and their love for being deep in the forest away from humans. 

## Final Words

Lake City may just be a small town located right smack dab in the middle of the Rockies, but it is an epicenter for hunters, hikers, campers, and all wildlife enthusiaists. Many believe that Yellowstone or Rocky Mountain National Park are the only places one can go to experience the Rocky mountains, but this is simply not true. While Lake City will not have the fancy hotels or shops, it will have true untamed wilderness, all without the thousands of tourists. If you wish to experience the Rockies in a new or different way, I recomend going to the Lake City area of the San Juan mountains. You will love the alpine mornings, and if you wait long enough you may just see a moose.
