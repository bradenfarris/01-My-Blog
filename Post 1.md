# Blog Post 1: Introductory Post

The purpose of this blog is to educate it's readers of the ecological properties of western Oklahoma and southern Colorado. The knowledge of the various locations that will be discussed comes from personal experiences from the author and from reading science based books. Every flora, fauna, and geological features that will be talked about, have been experienced first hand from myself. The nature of me being in these places was for pleasure, as the reason for me being specifically there was for camping and hiking. Each post will educate you on these specific places, and in the end I hope you will understand what makes the prairies and Rocky Mountains of America so unique. 

I also hope to inspire the audience to go where I have been and experience the amazing aspects of the American west. Hopefully with the knowledge I hope to give you, you can use it if you are ever in western Oklahoma and southern Colorado. The specific places I will discuss are the Wichita Mountains southwestern Oklahoma, Black Mesa in far western Oklahoma in the panhandle, and the San Juan Mountain range, centered around the Lake City area of Colorado. I have been to all three of these places on multiple occasions, most recently in July of 2018. 

Ecology of an environment is important because it is the balance in nature that keeps all living things going. This is why understanding the flora, fauna, geology, and climate of a certain area is essential for having all biology thrive. This is even more important when humans are interacting with certain areas. Every living thing in an environement affects another living thing, and in a way all biology depends on each other. Nature is very complex, so hopefully these blog posts can give a glimpse of what happens all across western America.
